# Dev Project - Hotel Booking Demand

---

This repo is for my "Dev Project" for IT 7113 - Data Visualization. The project consists of a python application using Plotly and Dash to create an interactive dashboard showcasing hotel booking demands for two hotels. Interactive interface elements exist to give the user control over the application to filter and compare different aspects of the data.

TO-DO:
- Add in graphs to show data.
- Create controls to interact with data.
- Upload to Heroku for showcasing the application.
- Create final report for project.
